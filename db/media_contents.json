A few humble strings of lights soon turned into a full-blown spectacle, growing over the years to include iconic scenes, nautical motifs and Cornish themes. Today, the lights, switched on from December until early January, span the entire harbour, wrapping buildings, boats and even the water's edge in a soft glow.",

The lake's emerald waters take on a softer tone, and Bled Island, with its quaint church, looks straight out of a winter fairytale, as seen in today's image. This over 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck.",

In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrate. This coral can grow to over 1 metre and is crucial to marine ecosystems.

Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are found in forests and open woodlands. Their range spans from the Himalayan foothills to Sri Lanka, though they are absent in the arid areas of western India. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York and Florida in the United States, and even parts of the Middle East. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech.",

The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!",

This park isn't only a natural wonder but a historical treasure, with fossilised human footprints dating back as far as 23,000 years, some of the oldest in North America. White Sands was established as a protected site in 1933 by President Hebert Hoover. What better way to celebrate than by immersing yourself in its beauty?

These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savannah, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. These stripes aren't just for show—they act as camouflage against predators by disrupting the outline of individual zebras within a herd. When it comes to food, they are not fuddy. Grass is their main dish, but they'll munch on leaves and barks if that's what's on the menu. They have a tough digestive system that lets them make the most of whatever they find, even if it's not the freshest. Plains zebras live in family groups, usually led by a dominant stallion, with mares and their foals forming the core of the herd.",

The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 to 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. These little champs spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival.",

The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world.

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.",

These penguins, found in coastal Patagonia, are known for their distinctive black and white bands and their loud, braying calls. They also mate with the same partner every year. They dig burrows near the coast to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. The male returns to burrows he used the year before and waits for his partner, who can recognise him by his voice alone. Their diet mainly consists of small fish, squid and krill. They can dive up to 50 metres depth to forage for food. In winter, they migrate north to warmer waters, sometimes reaching as far as southern Brazil. These penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies, where they communicate with each other through their distinctive calls. Fun fact: Penguins can drink seawater because they have a special gland that filters out the salt!",

Found across Europe, Asia and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. These semi-aquatic animals are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.",

The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength.",

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the title of the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life.

The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos.

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Their fur isn't truly white; it's translucent, reflecting visible light and allowing them to blend seamlessly into their snowy environment. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. Protecting polar bears means protecting their home—let's work together to slow the effects of climate change and safeguard their future.",

Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students. According to legend, an emperor's former wife, out of devotion, transformed into a tigress and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and emerged in eight incarnations, which is why it is known as the 'Tiger's Nest.' Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. There are three main routes to reach the monastery, with the most popular path winding through a forest decorated with prayer flags. The hike is demanding but rewarding, providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.",

This medium-sized bird measures about 48 to 50 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 60 centimetres and weighs 150 to 200 grams. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah.",

During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs.

With an area of 4,410 square kilometres, it is also the largest national park in Germany. It's a paradise for migratory birds like oystercatchers and red knots, seals and tiny creatures that thrive in the shifting sands. One of the best ways to experience the park is mudflat hiking.

Dating back to 3,000 BCE, this ancient burial site was crafted by the early Basque inhabitants and provides a glimpse into their spiritual practices. The dolmen consists of massive stones arranged in a formation that was used for burial purposes, and possibly, ceremonies. Over time, this megalith has withstood centuries of weathering and still serves as a powerful reminder of the past.",

These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.",

        "Description": "Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones', where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.",

Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky.

When younger, they lack spots, often resembling slender bottlenose dolphins. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. They're fast swimmers, known for their playful bow-riding and acrobatic, shallow leaps. These dolphins are amazing team players when it comes to hunting, as they often hunt in groups, working together to surround their prey, which includes small fish, benthic invertebrates and even squid. Interestingly, they prefer to hunt at night, making the most of the cover of darkness to catch their prey. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch.",

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse. It is a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

Spanning nearly 100 square kilometres, this UNESCO World Heritage site is famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. Among these unique formations is the enchanting Love Valley, known for its distinctive rock formations and stunning views. The park's rich history is equally captivating. For centuries, people have been carving homes, churches and even entire underground cities into the soft rock formations. These ancient dwellings, some dating back to the 4th century, served as places of refuge, especially for early Christians who sought protection from invaders. Göreme is a must-visit destination that offers something for everyone—whether you're a history enthusiast, an adventure seeker or simply someone looking to enjoy the serene beauty of this magical place.",

Hopping from branch to branch, it spends its days feasting on insects like caterpillars and beetles. These birds thrive in wetlands, woodlands and gardens, making their homes in shrubs and small trees. During the breeding season, males turn into tireless singers, hoping to win a mate with their sweet tunes. When it's time to nest, females carefully weave small cup-shaped homes from grass, plant fibres and feathers, ensuring a cosy spot for their eggs. But here's something impressive—yellow warblers won't tolerate freeloaders. If a brown-headed cowbird sneaks an egg into their nest, these clever birds simply build a new layer over it, protecting their own offspring. As summer ends, they embark on a journey south to Central and South America, spending the colder months basking in warmer climates before returning.",

Native to the Mediterranean Basin and areas around the Red Sea, it holds the unique distinction of being the only living member of the Chamaeleonidae family with a range that naturally extends into Europe. Did you know? These reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.",

This bridge, connecting the two banks of the Ville Rose, was built in 1849, then rebuilt in 1927 and 1987 to adapt to modern needs. Opposite it, the Dôme de la Grave, crowning the former hospital of the same name, dominates the landscape. This 19th-century architectural masterpiece is a symbol of Toulouse, visible from afar thanks to its imposing silhouette. Once dedicated to the sick and the poor, the Hôpital de la Grave bears witness to the city's medical past, and today it remains a centre of research and innovation.",

Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. Unfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever.",

Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to the waters, they face a range of threats from humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation. Today, a captive, self-sustaining population exists in the United States, with some living over 30 years in captivity.",

Established in 1980, it covers over 114,000 hectares of mountains, glaciers and deep valleys. It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 2,469 metres. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 18 kilometres in length and around a kilometre at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,000 metres above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'",

With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems.",

These flowers bloom during summer, providing long-lasting colour and attracting bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They are also appreciated for their low-maintenance nature and ability to naturalize. Unfortunately, wild Echinacea populations are under growing threat from excessive harvesting.

        "Description": "Steller sea lions might look like laid-back loungers on rocky shores, but they are noisy and nosy. Built with broad chests and thick necks, they are hard to miss. Today's image features Steller sea lions gliding through the chilly waters off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada. These marine mammals are heavy—females average more than 260 kilograms, while males are around 540 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

Spread over more than 320,000 hectares and originally part of Mexico, it became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a national park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.",

These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.",

The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue.",

These vivid colours also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here. It is also one of the few places in North America where traditional Irish communal land use practices—such as shared meadows and garden plots—have been preserved in both form and function.",

This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name.

It gained political prominence in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the largest cities in the world, with over a million residents. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. The city's skyline is defined by iconic skyscrapers such as the soaring Tokyo Skytree and the striking Metropolitan Government Building, while historic treasures like Senso-ji Temple, Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace Gardens provide a captivating window into Japan's rich cultural heritage.",

Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.",

These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.",

The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, United States, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 98,160 hectares, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.",

Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings.",

        "Description": "The ashy woodswallow, also known as the ashy swallow-shrike, is a sociable bird found across South and Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand and parts of China and Malaysia. Though absent from the driest regions of western India, it thrives in diverse habitats—from lowland plains to elevations of about 2,000 metres—often favouring areas with tall palm trees, forest clearings, and cultivated landscapes. These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.",

This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from approximately 16°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.",

The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.",

Created by artist Sérgio Cardoso in 2003, the work arrived before the roundabout itself—traffic circled around it before any road planning. Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.' And so, it remained: a spontaneous nickname, a reference that slipped out of control and became part of the urban landscape.

The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close.

To protect them, humans created man-made beehives—structures designed to house a honeybee nest, allowing them to live safely.

Among the many lighthouses, one of the most iconic in Denmark is the Lyngvig Lighthouse, featured here. Standing over 36-metre tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 16-metre dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.",

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.

This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. The canyon walls formed about 1.3 million years ago, when lava flowed from the Yellowstone Plateau. As it cooled and cracked, it created the striking basalt formations seen today. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.",

These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.",

Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. Their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.",

        "Description": "Featured in today's image is the grizzly bear, a symbol of the American wilderness. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still sprint faster than most humans. And it's not just their strength and speed that impress; a grizzly's sense of smell is so powerful, it can detect food from over 30 kilometres away—seven times better than a bloodhound's. Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies. Among many places in Alaska, Katmai National Park and Preserve is considered one of the best places in the world to observe grizzly bears in their natural habitat.",

Its journey began in 1999 when then-Minister for Information and the Arts, Lee Yock Suan, inaugurated the original space on the fifth floor of Ngee Ann City along Orchard Road. After closing in 2007 due to rising rents, the concept was revived and redefined—returning in 2014 to its present home at Orchard Gateway where it continues to inspire a new generation of readers and creators. Spanning two visually distinct levels—The Studio and The Loft—this 1,700-square-metre space holds a curated collection of 100,000 items. Developed in collaboration with students and lecturers from Singapore Polytechnic, this library is a dynamic environment for learning, expression and creative exploration in the heart of Orchard Road.",

The black-winged stilt, with its long, slender red legs, moves with quiet elegance through the shallows. Their presence sometimes evokes a quiet intimacy—two birds drifting close, their movements mirroring one another in a delicate choreography, as if sharing a secret only the wetlands can hear. They hunt with quiet precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Each movement reveals a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.",

Seen from 362 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.",

Its name literally translates as 'Bridge of Peace and Propitiousness,' reflecting its role as both a practical crossing and a symbol of the city. The original bridge was built in 1746 but suffered repeated damage from floods over the centuries. The current structure, completed in 2003, preserves the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans 81 metres in length and 6 metres in width. The bridge features handrails with traditional floral carvings, water-beast statues on the piers and memorial archways on each side, reflecting classic Chinese architecture. It serves as a cultural landmark and a hub for tourism, featuring a restaurant on the upper level, hosting occasional cultural events and offering an illuminated night view that has become one of Chengdu's most photographed attractions.",

Found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Hawaii in the United States to Africa's eastern coast, this reef-dweller is a true shapeshifter. Unlike most of its kin, it hunts in broad daylight, instantly shifting its colour, pattern and even skin texture to blend into its surroundings. At times, it even performs a clever 'passing clouds' act, casting a false shadow to trick crabs into moving at just the wrong moment. And once the trap is sprung, the hunter wastes no time. A skilled predator, this octopus prowls the reef for fish, crabs, prawns and molluscs. Smaller catches are devoured on the spot, while larger prey is dragged back to its den.",

The reefs act as a natural fortress, protecting the island from storms while sheltering countless species of fish.

Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.",

With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching more than 100 centimetres in length and standing over 70 centimetres tall at the shoulder, it is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares and squirrels.",

Interestingly, the heaviest pumpkin ever recorded weighed an incredible 1,246.9 kilograms. Despite their solid appearance, pumpkins can float effortlessly because they are 92% water. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes and parades. The colour of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green or even blue.

At more than 70 centimetres in length and weighing over a kilogram, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 8 centimetres long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 1,500 and 3,400 metres above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs and even rooftops in mountain towns.",

Hidden in Czechia's Hradec Králové Region, the Adršpach–Teplice Rocks form Central Europe's largest sandstone labyrinth. For centuries, the cliffs and passages lay cloaked in forest until a great fire stripped the land bare. Arches, towers and winding corridors emerged out of the ashes and the first hiking paths were carved into the rock. Soon after, explorers and poets left their marks with stone inscriptions that captured a destination both wild and enchanting.",

The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs and shifting empires. During World War II, Bran Castle was turned into a hospital for wounded soldiers by Princess Ileana, who was trained as a nurse. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad's ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula.' Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumours of Vlad's presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity's most enduring tales.",

About 4,350 light-years away and a few million years old, it is a stellar formation still in its earliest chapter. Despite its immense distance, it glimmers faintly in the night sky, one of only two star-forming nebulae visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes, alongside the famous Orion Nebula. First recorded by Giovanni Hodierna in 1654, it is located in the constellation Sagittarius. In long-exposure photographs, the Lagoon Nebula may appear pink, but when viewed through a telescope it looks grey, as the human eye struggles to detect colour in low-light conditions. So, if you ever try to spot it, don't be surprised by its muted appearance.",

These sandstone pillars, formed around 70 million years ago, are among Germany's most significant natural and cultural landmarks. They captivate visitors with their unique shapes and rich historical significance, attracting thousands each year. The rocks reach heights of up to 35 metres. As early as the Middle Ages, the site was used as a place of worship, as evidenced by a remarkable 12th-century relief carved into the stone depicting the Descent from the Cross.

Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators.

Even the central dome, rising 96 metres high, carries meaning: the height honours the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896.

Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine.",

It is a wilderness where caribou, Dall sheep and grizzly bears roam free and glaciers carve valleys that have existed for millennia. The park is a realm of extremes: its glaciers sprawling like frozen rivers, volcanic peaks piercing the sky. Among them stands Mount Blackburn, a 5,000-metre sentinel of ice and ancient fire. Its snow-mantled slopes feed vast glacier systems, a silent monument to geological time. Just beyond the park boundary, Willow Lake rests in the Copper River Basin—a roadside jewel along the Richardson Highway. On clear days, its glassy surface reflects the Wrangell Mountains in a panorama that feels endless: Blackburn's white shoulders rising against cobalt skies, mirrored in still waters where swans drift like living brushstrokes.",

Guanacos are part of the same camelid family as llamas, alpacas and vicuñas. But unlike their domesticated relatives, they keep things wild. Found mainly in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, they're built for life at high altitude. Their thick coats help them handle chilly winds, while their padded feet give them the grip to trek across rocky terrain that would make even mountain goats nervous.",

On the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia, along the border between Nepal and Tibet, stands Mount Everest. At over 8,800 metres, it is the world's highest peak and a symbol of human aspiration and natural beauty. In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber, were the first to successfully reach its summit, marking a historic achievement in exploration. Its glaciers feed rivers sustaining millions, showing that mountains are more than scenery—they are lifelines.",

This small, grey songbird, measuring about 15 centimetres in length, is a lively inhabitant of the eastern North America. Unlike other small songbirds, it has a tufted grey crest that crowns its head, giving it a distinctive and expressive look. Despite its small size, the tufted titmouse is surprisingly strong, able to crack open even large seeds with its beak—showcasing its skill and resourcefulness in the daily pursuit of food. It forages both in the trees and on the ground, searching for a varied diet of insects, nuts, seeds, berries and other invertebrates.",
