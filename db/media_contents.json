        "Description": "As the last notes of Christmas carols still linger in the air, let's visit the harbour of Mousehole, a fishing village in Cornwall, England, to keep the merriment going. Featured in today's image, Mousehole harbour is known for its Christmas illuminations. The Mousehole lights were first lit in the early 1960s, thanks to local artist Joan Gillchrest. A few humble strings of lights soon turned into a full-blown spectacle, growing over the years to include iconic scenes, nautical motifs and Cornish themes. Today, the lights, switched on from December until early January, span the entire harbour, wrapping buildings, boats and even the water's edge in a soft glow.",

        "Description": "Lake Bled in Slovenia gets plenty of attention in summer, but winter? That's when things slow down in the best way. The lake's emerald waters take on a softer tone, and Bled Island, with its quaint church, looks straight out of a winter fairytale, as seen in today's image. This over 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck.",

Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries year-round. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrate. This coral can grow to over 1 metre and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms.",

Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles.",
